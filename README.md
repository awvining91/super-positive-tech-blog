Stuff up to date on tech news on watch Elon Musk drive Twitter into the ground in real time!

## Challenges

I think the biggest challenge for me was being behind on challenges and trying to stay on top of them. On top of the that I spent most of my time working on project two, where two of our members dropped out and me and my teammate had to do all of the work.

## Next Steps

I want to be able to come back and finish up this challenge when I have more time and after I had a break so that I can work on this refreshed and
re-energized.
